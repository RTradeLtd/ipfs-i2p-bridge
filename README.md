ipfs-i2p-bridge
===============

Management tools for deploying an IPFS node modified to bridge with i2p. This is
a non-anonymous demo providing a backup means to connect to IPFS. Feel free to
experiment with it, but don't rely on it for anonymity. It's not capable of that
yet. This README will be changed when it might be able to do that.
